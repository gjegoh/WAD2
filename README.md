## üé∏ Project Overview ##
* Pepe Guitarra, a one stop classical guitar resources platform for all music-learners, providing them with reliable classical guitar resources - ranging from Scores to Useful Youtube Playlist.

## üé∏ Why Pepe Guitarra?  ##
* With the introduction of affordable or free music learning via online resources, people interested in music but lack money to opt for often expensive music tutors, are now able to effectively learn music through utilizing the many free but valuable resources available online.
* We understand that learning music can be expensive and with the internet in our hands, it can be difficult to find good and reliable music resources specifically Classical Guitar.
* Moreover, during this Covid-19 pandemic, with everyone facing increasing amounts of stress and anxiety while being coop up at home, many of us turn to new hobbies to relieve emotional stress. An effective healing activity for people.
* With all this considerations in mind, Pepe Guitarra is created.

## üé∏ For who?  ##
* For everyone.
* Pepe Guitarra is designed for everyone, anywhere, regardless of age.
    * People who are interested in learning the classical guitar for free online
    * Older people or people with disabilities that want to use online resources to learn the classical guitar

## üé∏ System Architecture Diagram  ##

  />

###### üéµ Spotify API ######
1. Request Access Token using Client details (Id, Secret Key)
1. Retrieve Access Token using Axios
1. Using the suitable Web API Console (Search the keyword "Classical Guitar", Input type as "Playlist")
    * https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=classical%20guitar&type=playlist&limit=20 
1. Return JSON object of all the playlists with keyword "Classical Guitar"
1. Display Spotify widget using Spotify API data

###### üìπ Youtube API ######
1. Identify 3 professional and popular classical guitar channels from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)
1. Use [Channels: list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list) to retrieve channel details by specifying channel names via Axios
    * sample url:https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=snippet,statistics,contentDetails&forUsername=SiccasGuitars&key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
    * response contains channel id, description and thumbnails
1. Use [ChannelSections: list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channelSections/list) to retrieve channel section details by specifying channel id via Axios
    * sample url:https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channelSections?part=snippet%2CcontentDetails&channelId=UCR39sLAZ5wS_vrMo4tRylHw&key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
    * response contains playlist id for each channel section
1. Construct data for the 3 identified channel in Vuejs. For each channel, specify their id, name, thumbnail, description, and section playlists
1. Note:
    * Why we dont let users to search and choose Youtube channels on their own? 
        + Since the api call for [Search: list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) has a quota cost of 100 units and we have limited free quota units, we decide to just identify and fix the top 3 classical guitar ourselves in our website and not let users to search and call api themselves to save quota units.
    * Why we would like to put our Youtube API response data in Vue but not call it everytime when user request it? Is it hardcoding?
        + Since we have already fixed our channels, the channel id and playlist id will not really change for each api call. Thus we would just like to save those channel details in Vue to save api call unit cost and website loading time. Also, since every iframe can actaully be seen as an api call and we are using playlist id in iframes to retrieve the videos, if the channel uploads new videos in the playlists, our website will also reflect the new uploads dynamically. Thus it is not hardcoded. 
    * Why we just show 2 playlist per channel?
        + Though there are more than 2 playlists for each channel, if we display all of them using iframe, it will significantly slow down the page loading. Thus we would just like to show 2 playlist per channel save loading time to prioritise user experience.


###### üìÅ Scores Page - Dealing with files ######
* In order to dynamically populate the lists of scores in the Scores page, an external python script getFileNames uses the glob function to retrieve all filenames in the three folders (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and then appends that to the resources html files. Everytime the folders are updated with new songs, simply running getFileNames once will automatically get the filenames and update the html files.


## üé∏ [OPTIONAL] How to Deploy Our Web Application (for Developers) - Netlify ##

            client_secret : 'd390b69d6d3d43469f7296e006f71704',
            data: "",
            token: "", // Store token

            // Default display, to be modified upon random_generate()
            display: [
                {name: 'Classical Guitar', link: '3sFlYchrFtMnxK6xY5uO27'},

## üé∏ X-Factors used ##
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    + What is it? It is a software development and version control service that uses Git.
    + How does this benefit our project? Our group splits work in such a way that each member owns certain components/parts of our project web application. We used GitHub to regularly check in and merge our source code so as to exercise continuous integration.

    + What is it? Vue.js is an open-source model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

* [animate.css](https://animate.style/#javascript)
    + What is it? Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in web projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and attention-guiding hints.
